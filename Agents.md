Read the docs: docs/Technical\ Specification\ Modular\ AI.txt to get context about our project and what we are trying to do:

Here is our implementation plan:

Integrate Configuration Loading

Use ConfigManager.load() to parse agents.yaml and instantiate agents with their descriptions. Update RouterAgent and server/CLI entry points to consume this configuration.

Implement Router Strategy

Replace SimpleStrategy with an LLM-driven strategy based on the technical spec. Initially use a simple keyword router, then integrate LangChain with OpenRouter for more accurate routing.

Add LLM Integration

Extend agents to utilize LangChain’s ChatOpenAI (through OpenRouter) to produce real responses. Ensure each agent’s generate_response method either returns a full message or yields tokens for streaming.

Tool Support

Connect the CalculatorTool (and future tools) to agents via the registry pattern. Allow agents to call tools using LangChain’s agent executor interface.

WebSocket Streaming

Update api/server.py to stream tokens back to the client using FastAPI WebSockets and LangChain’s async callbacks.

Enhance CLI

Modify api/cli.py to read configuration and optionally stream token-by-token output so the CLI matches the WebSocket experience.

Documentation

Expand README.md with details about configuration, environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_BASE), running tests, and how to extend the system with new agents or tools. Include architecture and sequence diagrams referenced in the specification.

Testing and CI

Add unit tests for agent registration, routing strategies, tool execution, and configuration parsing (as recommended in the spec). Configure pytest through Poetry.

Dockerization

Finalize the Dockerfile based on the instructions at lines 1080‑1118 of the specification, verifying that the container runs the server with environment variables for API keys.

You shoul dnow add the LLM Integration

Make sure there are tests, and also write documentation for what was implemented and how we should test it. 

Always follow good Solid design principles and use of design patterns, and we must have complete tests, and good coverage.
